I am a first year Masters student in QUARRG Lab at Queen's University under [Professor Sidney Givigi](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/people/Sidney/Givigi). I did my undergrad in my hometown of Cascavel, in the south of Brazil.

My research interests are Computer Vision and Deep Learning with applications on Autonomous Driving. More specifically, I am researching Cooperative Perception under Adverse Weather Conditions.
